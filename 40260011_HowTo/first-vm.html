        <h1>Creating your first VM</h1>
        <p>
    <strong>NOTE: </strong>
    To start a virtual machine, you must have a disk image for the Operating
    System you wish to emulate (usually a .iso file). For testing I personally
    used <a href="https://lubuntu.net/downloads/">Lubuntu</a>, a lightweight version of Ubuntu that provides the bare-bones
    basics for an operating system.
</p>
<p>
    The scripted version of this process can be found <a href = "https://github.com/bconnor270/ComputerScienceChallenges/tree/master/40260011_Scripts">here</a>. (FirstTimeInstallation.sh & RunVMNoNetworking.sh)
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Create your working directory</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    I like to create a directory to carry out the creation of the virtual
    machine within. Open up a terminal window and type the following command:
</p>

    <pre>&#9;mkdir QemuTesting</pre>

<p>
    You can then move your downloaded .iso file into this directory, and type
    the command
</p>
<pre>
    &#9;cd QemuTesting
</pre>
<p>
    To navigate into the directory from inside your terminal window.
</p>
<p>
  You can use the command:
</p>
<pre>
  &#9;ls
</pre>
<p>
  to list the files in the directory; make sure you can see your .iso file.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Using QEMU</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Firstly, we need to create a virtual hard drive image to have somewhere to
    install our emulated operating system to. QEMU provides the 'qemu-img' tool
    for this. Use the following command:
</p>
<pre>
    &#9;qemu-img create -f qcow2 test-image.img 10G
</pre>
<p>
    Command terms explained:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>'-f qcow2'</strong>
    : determines the format of the created hard disk image.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>'test-image.img'</strong>
    : the name of the image; you can change this to whatever you would like.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>'10G'</strong>
    : the <strong><em>potential</em></strong> size of the image; 10 gigabytes
    in this case is sufficient for most Linux distros; other operating systems
    may eventually require more.
</p>
<p>
    Note that this image file does not take up 10 gigabytes on the hard drive
    as soon as it has been created; this is merely the maximum capacity it
    could take. (It should start at around 150KB).
</p>
<p>
    Having created our disk image, we can now boot our virtual machine from our
    .iso file, and install the OS onto the virtual hard disk image we created.
    This is where QEMU's multitude of options and architecture possibilities
    come in, the scope of which is outside this tutorial but I will explain as
    best I can the different parameters.
</p>
<p>
    Use the following command to run the virtual machine:
</p>
<pre>
    &#9;sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -m 3072 -enable-kvm -boot d -hda test-image.img -cdrom lubuntu-18.04-alternate.iso
</pre>
<p>
    Command terms explained:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>'qemu-system-x86_64'</strong>
    : This is where we decide what architecture we want our virtual machine to
    take. QEMU supports many architectures a list of which you can view by
    typing 'qemu-system-' into a terminal window and then pressing the TAB key
    twice. In this case we are using the 64-bit Intel x86 platform.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>'-m 3072'</strong>
    : The amount of memory we want to allow the guest machine to use (in
    bytes). Change according to your needs.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>'-enable-kvm'</strong>
    : This command allows the KVM technology built into Linux to emulate the
    architecture we want. Without this command, QEMU will use software
    emulation which is considerably slower.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>'-boot d': </strong>
    This command allows you to specify the boot order. The 'd' option will
    prioritize the "CD-ROM" (your .iso file) over the hard disk image
    (test-image.img).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>'-hda test-image.img'</strong>
    : Here we specify the location of the hard drive we wish to use. In this
    case it is the 'test-image.img' we created earlier.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>'-cdrom lubuntu-18.04-alternate.iso'</strong>
    : Here we specify the .iso file we wish to boot from.
</p>
<p>
    After running this command, your virtual machine will appear in a separate
    window. <strong>DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL WINDOW</strong>, as this will
    terminate the QEMU process and hence your virtual machine.
</p>
<p>
    Once your emulated OS loads up, you can install the OS as you normally
    would onto your virtual hard drive image.
</p>
<p>
    Having installed your OS onto the test-image.img file, you can boot your
    virtual machine straight from it next time by using the same command as
    before, without the '-cdrom' and '-boot d' options:
</p>
<pre>
    &#9;sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -m 3072 -enable-kvm -hda test-image.img
</pre>
<p>
    Congratulations! You now have your first virtual machine up-and-running.
