    The process for creating a public bridge with a wireless host NIC is
    tricky. I found that documentation regarding this area was difficult to
    find and even more difficult to understand at times, so I hope this
    explanation helps. Some familiarity with basic networking will make this
    more readable.
</p>
<p>
    Firstly, a quick explanation of why this is necessary. The bridge virtual
    device does not support wireless traffic, and hence the strategy of
    creating a bridge between a TAP device and the host NIC (as we did for the
    wired connection) will not work.
</p>
<p>
The solution is to use <strong>Proxy ARP</strong> (<strong>A</strong>ddress    <strong>R</strong>esolution <strong>P</strong>rotocol). This is a layer 3
    solution, and it allows bridged clients to be part of the existing network,
    and protocols such as DHCP will still work with the appropriate helpers.
</p>
<p>
    Proxy ARP means a device on a given network will answer the ARP queries for
    a network address that is NOT on that given network. In short, the host
    machine will proxy ARP requests from the inside (or virtual) network to the
    outside, and respond to ARP requests from the outside network on behalf of
    the virtual hosts.
</p>
<p>
    Note that layer-2 protocols such as DHCP will be unable to cross our layer
    3 bridge, so we will need a helper utility for this to work. This is known
    as a DHCP Relay.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>How-To</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Firstly, there are some additional packages that we will need to install
    before we get started:
</p>
<pre>
    sudo apt-get install parprouted isc-dhcp-relay avahi-daemon
</pre>
<p>
    After these are installed, use the ifconfig command to determine the name
    and IP of your wireless NIC, and your network's IP range.
</p>
<pre>
    sudo ifconfig
</pre>
<p>
    For this example we will assume the host wireless NIC is wlan0 with IP
    192.168.0.33, and the network is 192.168.0.0 with netmask 255.255.255.0 (or
    suffix /24).
</p>
<p>
    Next, we need to create our TAP device:
</p>
<pre>
    sudo ip tuntap add tap0 mode tap user root
</pre>
<p>
    And then assign it an IP in the range of our network's IP range:
</p>
<pre>
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.43/24 dev tap0
</pre>
<p>
    Next, we can start a process called parprouted between our TAP device and
    our NIC. This will automatically create the appropriate routes for Proxy
    ARP:
</p>
<pre>
    sudo parprouted -d wlan0 tap0
</pre>
<p>
    <strong>LEAVE THIS TERMINAL WINDOW RUNNING</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Next, open another terminal window. For this step it is necessary that you
    know the IP address of the DHCP server on your network. (In my case this
    was 192.168.0.1). This is the terminal we will use to run our DHCP relay.
</p>
<p>
    To start this process, run the following command:
</p>
<pre>
    sudo dhcrelay 192.168.0.1 -i wlan0 -i tap0 -d
</pre>
<p>
    Replace the IP address shown with that of your DHCP server.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>LEAVE THIS TERMINAL WINDOW RUNNING</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Finally, open another terminal window and launch your VM with the following
    options:
</p>
<pre>
    sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -m 3072 -enable-kvm -hda lubuntu.img -net
    nic,macaddr=DE:AD:BE:EF:90:26 -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no
</pre>
<p>
    Congratulations! You now have a bridged wireless network and can interact
    with your VMs as though they were connected directly.
